#Functional Programming: A Primer

__Skill Level:__ Intermediate  
__Time Limit:__ 30-45 minutes  

Functional programming (FP) is the new hot topic in the world of programming. It's defined as a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

Though, there are a lot of terms & properties associated with FP including immutable data, first class functions, and tail call optimisation. It can best be characterised as... 

> The absence of side effects. It doesn't rely on data outside the current function, and it doesnt change data that exists outside the current function.
> -- Mary Rose Cook

##Instructions
- Implement each exercise and follow the instructions 
- Review these [glossary terms](/glossary.md)

##Things to consider
- Do not use shared or global variables
- Don't iterate over lists. Use map and reduce
- Use functions that take parameters 
- Don't instantiate variables inside of functions
- Handle all data changes with return values
- Utilize recursion when possible
